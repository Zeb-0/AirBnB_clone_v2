## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of the project. It enables you to interact with the application through the command line interface. Here's how to get started:

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
./console.py
\`\`\`

### How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to manage objects within the project. Here are some examples of commands you can use:

- To create a new User object: \`create User\`
- To show all objects: \`all\`
- To update an attribute: \`update User 1234 first_name \"John\"\`
- To quit the command interpreter: \`quit\`

### Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the command interpreter:

1. Creating a new User:
   \`\`\`
   (hbnb) create User
   \`\`\`

2. Displaying all objects:
   \`\`\`
   (hbnb) all
   \`\`\`

3. Updating an attribute:
